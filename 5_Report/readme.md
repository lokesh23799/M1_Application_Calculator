  Description:
          

        1:This project is about making a digital simple calculator .

        2:This work is centered on the design and implementation of calculator for education organization.

        3:To make a easier working tool capable of mathematical knowledge and solving sophisticated problems.

        4:The Project is primarily focused on numbers and arithemetic operations.

        5:It will help in calculating mathematical problems,and also easy to retrieval of project.



   Research:
           
  
          To make C program for the a simple alculator which can calculate Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, finding Square,Cube, and Percentage of the numbers.

          It may be little bit tricky but here we will use the basic concepts of C programming as follows:

          function call,

          recursion,

          if-else statement

          switch-case



Cost and Features:
  
          • The advantage of this project the the quickness in which the program works and no need to perform heavy calculation which will be taken care by the program

          • A lot of time and money can be saved in this project as the result leads to quick installation and accurate results.

 Defining MY System:
  
          • The system will be getting some essential paramenters from the user and it will compute the values and with which it will be able to choose or design the product.


   
  4W's and 1'H:
   
       Who:
           • Intended for people who want to calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication,division, square, cube and percentage of numbers.

       What:
           • It provides you with quick calculation arithmetic problems.

       When:
           • When students or anyone can use this calculator for education or teaching purpose.

       Where:
           • Users can use this application on their desktop or laptop terminal.
           
       How:
           •	Thinking about how the computations involved in finding the calculations can be easily implemented programmatically.

Requirements:


         High level:
                    1:Program will do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. (Implemented)
                    
                    2:It will find also find square, cube, and percentage of numbers.   (Implemented)
                    

         Low level :
                    1:Variables are used to store results ,take operations, and take numeric values.  (Implemented)
                    
                    2:Switch case is used to jump to operators selected by user.  (Implemented)
                    
                    3:Divide operations will not divide bh zero.  (Implemented)
