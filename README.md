# M1_Application_Calculator
I have made a C program for the simpe Calculator which can calculate Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, finding Square,Cube, and Percentage of the numbers.

Some basics of C that is used in this calculator project are as follows:

function call,

recursion,

if-else statement

switch-case

Thanks LTTS for giving me the opportunity to make a project on my own using the concepts of C programming.
